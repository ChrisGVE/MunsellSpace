# ISCC-NBS Accuracy Requirements for Munsell Conversion

## Updated Accuracy Standards (January 2025)

Based on ISCC-NBS mapping transition points, we now focus accuracy validation on specific critical values only.

### Critical Value Transitions
**Value must be exactly correct for these transitions:**
- 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5

**Non-critical values:** All other values (e.g., 3.2, 4.1, 6.8) can deviate from Python implementation without penalty.

**Example:**
- ✅ ACCEPTABLE: Python=3.2, Rust=3.3 (non-critical value)
- ❌ ERROR: Python=3.0, Rust=2.9 or 3.1 (critical value deviation)

### Critical Chroma Transitions  
**Chroma must be exactly correct for these transitions:**
- 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.2, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 13.0, 14.0, 15.0

**Non-critical values:** All other chromas (e.g., 4.2, 7.3, 12.1) can deviate without penalty.

**Example:**
- ✅ ACCEPTABLE: Python=4.2, Rust=4.4 (non-critical chroma)  
- ❌ ERROR: Python=5.0, Rust=4.9 or 5.1 (critical chroma deviation)

### Hue Requirements
**All hue values remain critical** - must match exactly or be equivalent boundary representations.

### Rationale
These specific values correspond to transition points in the ISCC-NBS color name mapping system. Colors that cross these thresholds may be assigned different color names, making exact accuracy at these points crucial for practical applications.

At our current precision level (76.78% overall accuracy), non-critical value deviations are acceptable and don't impact real-world color classification.

### Implementation Impact
- Significantly reduces false-positive errors in backtesting
- Focuses development effort on truly critical accuracy points
- Aligns validation with practical color naming applications
- Maintains scientific rigor where it matters most
