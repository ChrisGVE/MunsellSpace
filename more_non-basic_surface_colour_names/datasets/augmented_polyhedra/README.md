# Augmented Centore Polyhedra

This directory contains Centore's 30 polyhedra augmented with surface color data.

## Generation

Generated by: `scripts/augment_centore_polyhedra.py`

## Contents

### Individual Family Files

Each `{family}_augmented.json` file contains:
- `family`: Color family name
- `original_samples`: Number of samples in Centore's original polyhedron
- `surface_samples_added`: Number of surface color samples added
- `total_points`: Total vertices used in augmented polyhedron
- `original_centroid`: Centroid of Centore's original polyhedron (Cartesian coordinates)
- `augmented_centroid`: Centroid of augmented polyhedron
- `centroid_shift`: Euclidean distance between original and augmented centroids (Munsell units)
- `vertices`: Vertices of the augmented convex hull
- `faces`: Face indices of the convex hull
- `volume`: Volume of the augmented polyhedron
- `surface_sources`: List of data sources used for augmentation
- `surface_colors`: Detailed list of surface colors added

### Summary Report

`augmentation_report.md`: Comprehensive analysis including:
- Summary statistics
- Augmentation results by family
- Families with significant deviation (>2 Munsell units shift)
- Data quality notes

## Data Sources

### HIGH Confidence (Native Spectrophotometer)
- **Golden Acrylics**: 118 colors
- **Williamsburg Oils**: 168 colors

### MEDIUM Confidence (RGB-derived from Surface Standards)
- **NCS (Natural Color System)**: 5,000 colors
- **RAL Classic**: 216 colors
- **RHS Colour Chart**: 820 colors

## Key Findings

- **Total families augmented**: 30
- **Total surface samples added**: 5,852
- **Average centroid shift**: 2.24 Munsell units
- **Families with significant deviation**: 14

### Families with Good Consistency (<2 units shift)
- red, gold, peach, gray, white, beige, lavender, lilac, navy, orange, pink, purple, rose, sand, taupe, turquoise

### Families Requiring Review (>2 units shift)
- magenta (8.92 units)
- fuchsia (5.99 units)
- coral (5.15 units)
- blue (4.96 units)
- aqua (3.66 units)

Large centroid shifts suggest that surface color data may have different characteristics than Centore's CAUS dataset (crowdsourced naming study). This is expected as different methodologies and data sources may capture different aspects of color perception.

## Coordinate System

Cartesian coordinates follow Centore's convention:
- **x**: chroma × cos(hue_radians)
- **y**: chroma × sin(hue_radians)
- **z**: value (lightness)

Hue is mapped to the 0-100 scale then converted to radians.

## Usage

These augmented polyhedra can be used to:
1. Improve semantic color naming by incorporating surface color characteristics
2. Validate polyhedra boundaries against real-world surface colors
3. Identify families where crowdsourced naming differs from professional standards
4. Build hybrid models combining screen-based and surface-based color data

## Next Steps

See Task 67 completion notes and Phase 2.2 for integration into overlay system.
