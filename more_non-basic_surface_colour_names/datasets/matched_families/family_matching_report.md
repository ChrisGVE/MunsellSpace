## Analysis: Dropped Centore Families

The following Centore 30 families lack surface data:

- **beige** (non-basic): 18 screen samples, no surface polyhedron
- **lavender** (non-basic): 25 screen samples, no surface polyhedron
- **lilac** (non-basic): 15 screen samples, no surface polyhedron
- **navy** (non-basic): 6 screen samples, no surface polyhedron
- **orange** (basic): 51 screen samples, no surface polyhedron
- **pink** (basic): 62 screen samples, no surface polyhedron
- **purple** (basic): 68 screen samples, no surface polyhedron
- **rose** (non-basic): 27 screen samples, no surface polyhedron
- **sand** (non-basic): 27 screen samples, no surface polyhedron
- **taupe** (non-basic): 15 screen samples, no surface polyhedron
- **turquoise** (non-basic): 12 screen samples, no surface polyhedron

These families cannot be compared until surface color data is collected.

## Recommendations

1. **Proceed with comparison** for the 23 matched families
2. **Data collection needed** for 12 families missing from surface dataset
3. **Priority collection targets:**
   - purple (68 screen samples)
   - pink (62 screen samples)
   - orange (51 screen samples)
   - rose (27 screen samples)
   - sand (27 screen samples)
