### Goals for This Phase
1. Validate current mathematical conversion accuracy through comprehensive testing
2. Update version numbers and prepare release metadata for publication
3. Merge feature branch to main branch
4. Publish to crates.io (Rust) and PyPI (Python)

### Tasks Required
1. Run comprehensive test suite to validate readiness
2. Update version numbers and prepare release metadata  
3. Merge feature branch to main
4. Prepare and execute publication to crates.io and PyPI

### Success Criteria
- All tests pass with high accuracy
- Clean merge to main without conflicts
- Successful publication to both package registries
- Library is ready for production use
