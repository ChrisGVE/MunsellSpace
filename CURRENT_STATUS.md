# Current Status - Mathematical Munsell Conversion

## Executive Summary
**CRITICAL**: The mathematical conversion implementation has experienced a severe accuracy regression. Initial attempts to fix the algorithm based on Python colour-science analysis have made the situation worse, not better.

## Timeline of Events

### Initial State (commit e49d851)
- **Accuracy**: 61.08% exact matches with Python
- **Family mismatches**: 17 (0.43%)
- **Status**: Working dual-loop iterative algorithm

### After Attempted Fixes (commits dde0c3d through caf54c8)
- **Accuracy**: 3.57% exact matches with Python (MAJOR REGRESSION)
- **Family mismatches**: 3319 (82.9%) (CATASTROPHIC INCREASE)
- **Status**: Algorithm broken

### After Reverting Fixes (current state)
- **Accuracy**: Still 3.57% (reverting didn't help)
- **Family mismatches**: Still 3319
- **Status**: Algorithm remains broken

## Attempted Fixes That Failed

1. **Achromatic threshold**: Changed from 1e-6 to 1e-3
   - **Rationale**: Python uses 1e-3
   - **Result**: Made accuracy worse
   - **Status**: Reverted

2. **Hue==0 normalization**: Added family code increment
   - **Rationale**: Python increments code when hue==0
   - **Result**: Created duplicate normalization
   - **Status**: Reverted

3. **Chroma==0 handling**: Return achromatic when chroma==0
   - **Rationale**: Python returns achromatic for chroma==0
   - **Result**: Too aggressive, broke valid colors
   - **Status**: Reverted

4. **Extrapolation logic**: Enable after 2 points instead of 4
   - **Rationale**: Python enables after 2 points
   - **Result**: Made convergence worse
   - **Status**: Reverted

5. **Linear interpolation for chroma**: No extrapolation
   - **Rationale**: Prevent negative chromas
   - **Result**: Didn't improve accuracy
   - **Status**: Reverted

## Root Cause Analysis

The regression suggests fundamental issues:

1. **Context mismatch**: Our algorithm works in D65 space (from sRGB) but uses some Illuminant C constants
2. **Algorithm structure**: The Python analysis may have been misinterpreted
3. **Implementation details**: Small details matter enormously in this algorithm
4. **Convergence issues**: The iterative algorithm may not be converging properly

## Critical Observations

1. The algorithm was achieving 61% accuracy before any "fixes"
2. All attempted fixes made things worse
3. Reverting the fixes didn't restore the original accuracy
4. Something fundamental is broken in the current implementation

## Next Steps Required

1. **Restore working state**: Need to identify exact commit where 61% accuracy was achieved
2. **Careful analysis**: Re-examine the Python implementation more carefully
3. **Incremental changes**: Make ONE change at a time and test thoroughly
4. **Focus on root causes**: Fix the fundamental issues before tweaking parameters

## Success Criteria (Original)

- Match Python's accuracy: ≤2 family mismatches
- All dimension differences ≤0.1 for all 4007 colors
- Currently FAILING both criteria by massive margins

## Recommendation

**STOP making changes based on the current analysis.** The algorithm needs to be restored to a working state first, then carefully debugged to understand why it's not matching Python exactly. The current approach of applying multiple "fixes" simultaneously has proven counterproductive.
