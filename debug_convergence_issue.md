# Convergence Issue Analysis

## Problem
Our algorithm gets stuck at 8.1R 5.2/19.6 while Python produces 7.9R 5.2/20.4

## Convergence Quality
- Python: euclidean distance = 0.000746
- Rust: euclidean distance = 0.002845 (3.8x worse)

## Observation from iterations
After iteration 3, our algorithm gets stuck:
- Hue stays constant at 8.062803
- Chroma slowly decreases but doesn't really converge
- The algorithm seems to be stuck in a local minimum

## Possible issues
1. The inner hue angle loop might not be collecting enough points to extrapolate correctly
2. The chroma refinement loop condition might be wrong
3. We might not be handling the extrapolation correctly when phi differences change sign

## Key differences to investigate
1. Python uses `<=` and `>=` for range checks, we might be using `<` and `>`
2. Python's extrapolation might be more sophisticated than simple linear interpolation
3. The way we calculate phi differences might have subtle differences in wrapping

## Next steps
1. Add more detailed debug output to see what's happening in the inner loops
2. Check if we're collecting enough phi_differences data points
3. Verify the chroma refinement loop is working correctly
4. Make sure our extrapolation is working when phi differences change sign
