"""Debug the inner loop calculation"""

# From iteration 2:
# Current angle: 356.1°
# phi_input: -7.066°
# phi at that point is probably very close to -7.066° since diff=0.0°

# When phi_input ≈ phi_current, the step is ≈ 0
# This means the inner loop tests:
# - iteration 0: angle = 356.1 + 0 * 0 = 356.1°
# - iteration 1: angle = 356.1 + 1 * 0 = 356.1°

# All iterations test the same angle!
# The phi differences will all be approximately the same
# When we interpolate/extrapolate to find where phi_diff = 0,
# if all points have the same phi_diff, the result is indeterminate

# This explains why we get diff=0.0° - the interpolation can't find
# a meaningful correction when all test points are the same
