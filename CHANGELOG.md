## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Ready for production publication to crates.io
- Merged feature/true-mathematical-conversion branch to main

## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-15

### Added
- **ISCC-NBS Color Classification System**: Complete implementation with 267 standardized color names
- **Multiple Illuminant Support**: C, D65, and F7 illuminants with chromatic adaptation
- **Chromatic Adaptation Methods**: XYZ Scaling, Bradford, and CAT02 transforms
- **Lab Color Space Support**: Direct Lab to Munsell conversion
- **Hex Color Support**: Convert hex color codes to Munsell notation
- **Thread Safety**: Full `Send + Sync` implementations for concurrent processing
- **Parallel Processing**: Rayon integration for batch operations
- **Caching System**: Automatic result caching for improved performance
- **Mechanical Wedge System**: Accurate ISCC-NBS boundary determination
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Property-based tests, edge cases, and benchmarks

### Changed
- Renamed `IsccNbsClassifier` to `ISCC_NBS_Classifier` for consistency
- Replaced `RefCell` with `Arc<RwLock>` for thread-safe caching
- Optimized mathematical operations with inline hints
- Enhanced documentation with detailed examples

### Fixed
- Mechanical wedge boundary rule for 1R wraparound case
- Cache method signatures after optimization
- Documentation examples to pass doc tests
- Gray/grey spelling consistency

### Performance Improvements
- Matrix operation optimizations
- Geometric calculation optimizations
- Inline hints for hot code paths
- Efficient caching strategies

## [1.0.0] - 2024-11-01

### Added
- Initial stable release of MunsellSpace library
- Core sRGB to Munsell color space conversion
- High-precision mathematical algorithms based on Python colour-science
- Reference dataset with 4,007 validated color mappings
- Comprehensive error handling with custom error types
- Full documentation with examples
- Integration tests with reference dataset validation
- MIT License

### Features
- **Core Conversion**: RGB to Munsell notation with high accuracy
- **Color Systems**: Support for all Munsell hue families (R, YR, Y, GY, G, BG, B, PB, P, RP)
- **Value Range**: 0 (black) to 10 (white)
- **Chroma Support**: 0 (neutral) to variable maximum
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient conversion of multiple colors
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing with validation

### Technical Implementation
- sRGB gamma correction (ITU-R BT.709)
- Linear RGB to XYZ transformation
- XYZ to xyY chromaticity conversion
- D65 illuminant as default
- Nearest neighbor matching for reference colors

### Performance
- Single conversion: <1ms per color
- Batch processing: 4,000+ colors/second
- Memory usage: <100MB for complete reference dataset

## [0.9.0] - 2024-10-15 (Beta)

### Added
- Beta release for testing and feedback
- Core conversion pipeline implementation
- Basic test suite
- Initial documentation draft

### Known Limitations
- Single-threaded processing only
- Limited to D65 illuminant
- No ISCC-NBS support
- No Lab color space support

## Migration Guides

### Upgrading from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0

#### New Features Available
- ISCC-NBS classification: Use `ISCC_NBS_Classifier` for color names
- Multiple illuminants: Configure with `Illuminant::C`, `Illuminant::F7`
- Thread-safe processing: Share converters with `Arc<T>`
- Lab/Hex support: New conversion methods available

#### API Changes
- `IsccNbsClassifier` â†’ `ISCC_NBS_Classifier` (if using preview features)
- All types now implement `Send + Sync`
- New methods: `lab_to_munsell()`, `hex_to_munsell()`

### Upgrading from 0.9.0 to 1.0.0

Complete API redesign - please refer to new documentation.
