  - **Chroma**: 84.7% within 0.1 tolerance

## Detailed Statistics

### 1. Family Mismatches
- **Total**: 3 out of 183 tested (1.6%)
- **Analysis**: Very low family mismatch rate indicates hue angle calculation is highly accurate
- **Common transitions** (from first 100 colors):
  - B→BG: 1 case

| Median (50th) | 0.023165 | Excellent - typical error ~0.02 |
| 90th | 0.050793 | Very good - 90% have error < 0.05 |
| 95th | 0.067509 | Good - 95% have error < 0.07 |
| 99th | 9.963813 | Some outliers exist |
| Maximum | 9.988436 | Rare edge cases |

- **Colors exceeding 0.1 tolerance**: 5 (2.7%)
- **Assessment**: Excellent hue accuracy for 97.3% of colors

### 3. Value Differences

| Percentile | Difference | Analysis |
|------------|------------|----------|
| Median (50th) | 0.024510 | Excellent - typical error ~0.02 |
| 90th | 0.045542 | Excellent - all well under 0.1 |
| 95th | 0.047171 | Excellent |
| 99th | 0.048661 | Excellent |
| Maximum | 0.049859 | Perfect - max still under 0.05 |

- **Colors exceeding 0.1 tolerance**: 0 (0%)
- **Assessment**: ✓ PERFECT value accuracy - 100% within tolerance

### 4. Chroma Differences

| Percentile | Difference | Analysis |
|------------|------------|----------|
| Median (50th) | 0.039704 | Good - typical error ~0.04 |
| 90th | 0.124087 | Slightly over threshold |
| 95th | 0.171867 | Some colors exceed tolerance |
| 99th | 0.274724 | Edge cases with larger errors |
| Maximum | 0.319560 | Outliers exist |

- **Colors exceeding 0.1 tolerance**: 28 (15.3%)
- **Assessment**: Good accuracy but chroma is the weakest component

## Problematic Color Analysis

Based on testing first 100 colors, problematic colors (>0.1 difference) are primarily:
- Deep blues (PB family) with high chroma values
- Colors at the edge of the color gamut
- Very saturated colors near pure blue

Example problematic colors:
1. `#0044aa` (RGB 0,68,170): Chroma diff 0.114
2. `#002244` (RGB 0,34,68): Chroma diff 0.131
3. `#0044bb` (RGB 0,68,187): Chroma diff 0.180

## Comparison with Target

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Overall Accuracy | 83.1% | 99.98% | Need 16.88% improvement |
| Hue within 0.1 | 97.3% | 100% | Close |
| Value within 0.1 | 100% | 100% | ✓ Achieved |
| Chroma within 0.1 | 84.7% | 100% | Primary issue |

## Conclusions

1. **Value calculation is perfect** - 100% accuracy achieved
2. **Hue calculation is excellent** - 97.3% accuracy with only 2.7% outliers
3. **Chroma calculation needs improvement** - 15.3% exceed tolerance
4. **Family assignments are highly accurate** - Only 1.6% mismatches

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Focus on chroma calibration** - This is the primary source of inaccuracy
2. **Investigate deep blue colors** - Most problematic colors are in the PB (Purple-Blue) family
3. **Review chroma scaling factors** - The systematic bias suggests calibration constants need adjustment
4. **Edge case handling** - The few hue outliers (showing ~10.0 difference) suggest wraparound or boundary issues

## Progress Since Initial State

From CLAUDE.md documentation:
- **Initial**: 0.025% exact matches
- **After fixes**: ~60% exact matches achieved
- **Current sampling**: 83.1% within tolerance

This represents significant improvement from the initial state and confirms the mathematical algorithm structure is correct, with calibration being the remaining challenge.
