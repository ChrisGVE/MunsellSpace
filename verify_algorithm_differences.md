# Algorithm Verification Checklist

## Critical Points to Verify

### 1. Dataset Y Values
- [x] **FIXED**: Python dataset has Y values scaled by 1/0.975 (they are ~2.6% larger than actual)
- [x] **FIXED**: We were incorrectly applying additional 0.975 scaling
- [x] **RESULT**: With corrected dataset, chroma improved from 19.6 to 20.0 (vs Python 20.4)

### 2. Illuminant Handling
- [ ] Python uses Illuminant C for Munsell calculations
- [ ] We need proper chromatic adaptation from D65 (sRGB) to C
- [ ] Check if we're using correct white points throughout

### 3. Iterative Algorithm Issues (MAIN PROBLEM)
Current behavior: Algorithm oscillates between 8.011940 and 8.062803
Python result: 7.9R
Our result: 8.1R

Issues identified:
- When phi_input == phi_current, step size becomes 0
- Algorithm gets stuck in local minimum
- Our extrapolation produces inconsistent corrections

### 4. Inner Loop Logic
Python: `hue_angle_inner = (hue_angle_current + iterations_inner * (phi_input - phi_current)) % 360`
- When phi_input == phi_current, this gives 0 step
- How does Python avoid getting stuck?

### 5. Convergence Criteria
- Python converges to euclidean distance 0.000746
- We get stuck at 0.002845 (3.8x worse)
- We reach a point where phi matches but xy doesn't

### 6. Missing Elements to Check
- [ ] Exact interpolation method used in xy_from_renotation_ovoid
- [ ] How Python handles boundary cases
- [ ] Whether there's additional smoothing or relaxation
- [ ] Exact convergence threshold used

### 7. Numerical Precision
- [ ] Are we using same precision (f64 vs Python's float64)?
- [ ] Rounding differences in intermediate calculations?
- [ ] Different tolerance values?
